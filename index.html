<h1>Welcome to the TNE WebNICE application</h1>

<p>An important part of our activities is to develop useful computational models that can provide reliable and accurate predictions of the interaction between neuroprosthetic technologies and the human body. These models help to understand the fundamental mechanisms at stake, explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and identify critical components in order to optimize our neurotechnologies.</p>

<p>This website hosts an <a href="https://tnewebnice.epfl.ch/viewer">interactive tool</a> to visualize the predicted responses of different types of neurons to to various acoustic stimuli, according to the Neuronal Intramembrane Cavitation Excitation (NICE) model (Krasovitski et al., 2011; Plaksin et al., 2014, 2016). It is meant as a comparative tool for researchers working on Ultrasound Neuromodulation applications, to quickly explore different combinations of stimulation parameters of specific cell types, and retrieve the mechanical and electrical responses predicted by the model (as well as all internal variables) for comparisons with their experimental findings. Alternative theoretical models should be added in the near future.</p>

<p>This tool is currently restricted to our collaborators until further notice hence the web page is password protected. However if you are interested in collaboration don't hesitate to contact us (<u>theo.lemaire@epfl.ch</u>) to see how we can grant you access.</p>

<p>You can also check our <a href="https://tne.epfl.ch">Laboratory website</a> where you can find more information about our staff and research activities.</p>

<p><b><em>Thank you for your interest in the TNE WebNICE application.</em></b></p>
