This web app is a project initiated by the [Translational Neural Engineering Laboratory](https://tne.epfl.ch), member of the Center for Neuroprosthetics of EPFL, in collaboration with the [IT'IS Foundation](https://www.itis.ethz.ch) for Research on Information Technologies in Society.

It hosts an interactive web app that allows to visualize the responses of different types of neurons Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (LIFUS), as predicted by the *multiScale Optimized Intramembrane Cavitation (SONIC)* model (Lemaire et al., 2019). This model is a novel, effective implementation of the *Neuronal Intramembrane Cavitation Excitation (NICE)* model (Krasovitski et al., 2011, Plaksin et al., 2014, 2016).

For comparison purposes, neural responses to injected intracellular currents predicted by point-neuron Hodgkin-Huxley models (Pospischil et al., 2008) can also be visualized.

The viewer is meant as a comparative tool for researchers working on Ultrasound Neuromodulation applications, to quickly explore different combinations of stimulation parameters of specific cell types, and retrieve the mechanical and/or electrical responses predicted by the model (as well as all internal variables) for comparisons with their experimental findings. Alternative theoretical models should be added in the near future.
