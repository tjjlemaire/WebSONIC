The SONIC web app is meant as an interactive tool to explore the responses of different types of neurons Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (LIFUS), as predicted by the *multiScale Optimized Intramembrane Cavitation (SONIC)* model (Lemaire et al., 2019), an effective and interpretable implementation of the *Neuronal Intramembrane Cavitation Excitation (NICE)* model (Krasovitski et al., 2011, Plaksin et al., 2014, 2016). For comparison purposes, responses of the same neurons to injected intracellular currents can also be visualized.

The SONIC model is part of a bigger modeling effort carried out at the [EPFL Translational Neural Engineering Lab](https://tne.epfl.ch), in collaboration with the [IT'IS Foundation](https://www.itis.ethz.ch), to provide a quantitative, biophysical basis to observed ultrasound neuromodulatory effects.

Researchers interested in using the model to help design their experiments and / or compare their experimental findings against theoretical predictions and encouraged to get in touch! We will gladly share our code upon reasonable request.
