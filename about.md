Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (LIFUS) is emerging as a promising technology for noninvasive brain stimulation, but many questions remain regarding its mechanisms of action as well as optimal stimulation parameters.

One candidate mechanism is that of *intramembrane cavitation*, in which LIFUS induces high-frequency mechanical deflections of the neural membrane to generate depolarizing currents and trigger action potentials. This phernomenon is decribed mathematically by a *Neuronal Intramembrane Cavitation Excitation (NICE)* model ([Krasovitski et al., 2011](https://www.pnas.org/content/108/8/3258), [Plaksin et al., 2014](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.011004), [Plaksin et al., 2016](https://www.eneuro.org/content/3/3/ENEURO.0136-15.2016)), whose predictions of cell-type-specific LIFUS responses corroborate a wide range of experimental results on LIFUS-evoked brain activity. However, the NICE model is conceptually complex and  tedious to simulate, thereby limiting its adoption by the community. 

To adress these limitations, we recently developed a *multiScale Optimized Intramembrane Cavitation (SONIC)* model ([Lemaire et al., 2019](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ab1685)), a computationally efficient variant of the NICE model that also defines a more intuititve frame of interpretation for LIFUS-evoked responses.

This web app is meant as an interactive tool to explore the cell-type-specific LIFUS responses of different brain neurons (taken from [Pospischil et al. 2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0263-8)), as predicted by the SONIC model. For comparison purposes, responses of the same neurons to injected intracellular currents (using a simple Hodgkin-Huxley formalism) can also be visualized.

Researchers interested in using the SONIC model for in-depth investigations are encouraged to download the model code from our [online repository](https://github.com/tjjlemaire/PySONIC). It contains detailed instructions to use and expand the framework. We are also happy to assist fellow scientists in using the framework, and to implement additional features upon reasonable request.
