This web app allows to visualize the responses of different neuron types to Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (LIFUS), as predicted by the *multiScale Optimized Intramembrane Cavitation (SONIC) model* \[1\], an effective variant of the *Neuronal Intramembrane Cavitation Excitation (NICE) model* \[2-4\]. For comparison purposes, neural responses to injected intracellular currents (as predicted by point-neuron Hodgkin-Huxley models \[5\]) can also be visualized.

It is meant as an exploration tool to test the effect of different combinations of LIFUS parameters on specific neuron types. Neural responses predicted by the model can be visualized and downloaded for further analysis.
